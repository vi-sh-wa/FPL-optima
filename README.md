# FantasyPremierLeague
Hello!! This is my first project where I am parallely working on Github.
Everybody loves footbal and it has been a big part of my life. When I moved to the UK I found myself actively watching the PL and start transferring in and out players on the regular as one does based on how they performed the current form, chance of an assist or a goal, etc. So I sat there thinking if it's possible for us to get the best possible 11 for the upcoming weeks. Well there you go that is the aim of this project.
